# Bootstrap-Portfolio
My Personal Responsive Portfolio.
This homework was really fun as I worked through all the requirements.  This project gave me a real sense of how creative the development process can be.
The first step in this project was to determine which Bootstrap applications to use.  The first one I started working with was the Navbar and setting up the "About Me", "Portfolio", and "Contacts."
I set up the Navbar on on three pages in order to move around the site.  
The "About Me" page contains a picture of me and a paragraph about my life.  Below that I set up a 3x4 grid that lays out 12 travel pictures.
The "Portfolio" page contains a header annouincing more content to come.
The "Contact" page conatains my email link and a blank Github link.
I also set up a CSS style page that modifies various elements in the HTML.
I had attempted to use a carousel, but found it a bit cumbersome.  I would like to come back to this and figure out how to make it work.
