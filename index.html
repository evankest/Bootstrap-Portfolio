          <p>My name is Erik.  I'd say my favorite thing in the world is traveling and experiencing different cultures, places and food.  I have moved around quite a bit in my life.  I was born in 1970 and I'm originally from Denver, Colorado. My family moved to a little mountain town on the Navajo Indian Reservationin in northwest New Mexico when I was seven.  Definitely an interesting cultural experience as my brother and I were the only white kids in the whole school. When I was fourteen, we moved to Corpus Christi, Texas.  It was a great place for surf and sun. After High School, I joined the Army and spent time in Maryland and Germany.  In Maryland I started College, worked at the National Security Agency and did pro-environmental organizing with students from Georgetown University, American University and Western Maryland College (aka McDaniel College).  After Maryland, I was stationed in Augsburg, Germany, where I witnessed the end of the Cold War.  I traveled all around Germany, checking out everything from mad King Ludwig's castles to once-in-a-lifetime art shows like Documenta IX.  I also traveled to London, Prague and Salzburg.  Once I was done with the Army I moved back to Texas where I continued going to College.  In 1994 I moved to Seattle so I could attend Evergreen College.  That didn't work out so I attended the University of Washington instead while I worked at IKEA.  In 2001 I graduated from UW with a Bachelor's Degree in both English and Comparative History of Ideas.  My Ex and I then moved back to Texas, where I started working on my Paramedic Certification.  Being part of someone's worst day was extremely stressful, so I switched career paths and started working on my Teacher Certification.  From 2003 to 2006 I taught High School English at Ingleside High School and coached Volleyball.  My kiddo was born in 2005.  In 2006, we moved back to Seattle, where I started working at a Megayacht company, building multi-million dollar yachts.  I did that for 12 years before a turn in the economy led to mass lay offs.  I started working security at Facebook where I became a Site Supervisor for the Redmond Occulus account.  Currently I am enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp with the University of Washington.
